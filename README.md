# 🛒 Machine Learning for Retail Sales Forecasting — Feature Engineering

This project demonstrates how to design, preprocess, and engineer features to improve retail sales forecasting using machine learning techniques. It provides a structured workflow for preparing sales data and building models that can capture demand patterns across time, products, and stores.

## 📌 Project Overview

Accurate sales forecasting is critical for inventory planning, supply chain optimization, and revenue growth in retail. This project focuses on **feature engineering** — the most impactful step in any forecasting pipeline.

We explore:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Time-based features (lags, moving averages, seasonality indicators)
* Store and product-level features
* Holiday and event-based features
* Handling missing values and outliers

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:**

  * `pandas`, `numpy` (data processing)
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (visualization)
  * `scikit-learn` (ML models & preprocessing)
  * `xgboost`, `lightgbm` (boosted tree forecasting models)
